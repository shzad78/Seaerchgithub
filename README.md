npm scripts

We've captured many of the most useful commands in npm scripts defined in the package.json:

npm start - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
npm run tsc - runs the TypeScript compiler once.
npm run tsc:w - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.
npm run lite - runs the lite-server, a light-weight, static file server, written and maintained by John Papa and Christopher Martin with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing.
npm run typings - runs the typings tool.
npm run postinstall - called by npm automatically after it successfully completes package installation. This script installs the TypeScript definition files this app requires. Here are the test related scripts:
npm test - compiles, runs and watches the karma unit tests
npm run e2e - run protractor e2e tests, written in JavaScript (*e2e-spec.js)
